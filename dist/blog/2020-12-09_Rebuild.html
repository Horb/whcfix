<h1>2020-12-19 Rebuild</h1>
<p>I've been neglecting whcfix.com for some time now, with regards to both the
operating system (CentOS 6, which recently passed it's end of life!) and the
aging application code which is no longer fit for a tiny (128MB!) server like
this one. I had considered abandoning the project entirely because the prospect
of updating all that Python 2 code isn't a very enjoyable prospect for a
hobby project.</p>
<p>Instead I've decided to rebuild whcfix.com from the ground up with the 
following goals;</p>
<ul>
<li>move to Debian, for docs</li>
<li>static website with dynamic content, for speed</li>
<li>use simple (think gnutils) tools, for nostalgia</li>
<li>functional approach, for purity</li>
<li>embrace CI/CD, for welfare</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rebuild Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>logged into VPS Control panel and reinstalled the operating system,
selecting Debian 10.</li>
<li>setup a local user and followed the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SSH">ssh setup guide</a>.</li>
<li>letsencrypt.org requires snap (?!) to install certbot which isn't supported
by the VPS. Instead I installed certbot from the debian packages and manually
configured the SSL certs by following the <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-handbook/sect.http-web-server.en.html">Web Server</a> guide.</li>
<li>to get the certs to work it's important to request all subdomains you want to
support, in this case www.whcfix.com and whcfix.com.</li>
</ul>
